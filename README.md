# Predicting-Fault-Codes-in-Wind-Turbines

The project was done in collaboration with two classmates (Maeve Emery and Eric Wiederin) for my Data Analytics capstone class in Spring of 2023. The entire project was done in R. We worked with an industry partner to develop models to predict fault codes in wind turbines. The data required extensive cleaning, aggregating, and standardizing. As a group, we developed both K-Nearest-Neighbor models and random forest models. We also took a particular interest in making efficent and less-computationally intensive models, so we created a dataset that summarized the data from each day, with a binary vairable stating if there would be a fault code the next day. This dataset was particularly successful when used to train a random forest model.
